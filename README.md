Practice for scraping data from a div container within Amazon
Original code from https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/10/building-amazon-product-scraper-nodejs/

I am going to go and refactor the code.
I tried to refactor it with realtor.ca but they don't allow scraping from their site
I am going to work on scraping indeed for junior software engineering jobs

Clone project

To start
npm i
this will install all libaries

currently npm start starts the index.js file with nodemon for testing purposes

it would be great to email the findings to me. I have to figure that out
